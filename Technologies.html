          Welcome to my About page! I'm Muhammad Zubair, a passionate software
          engineer with a deep love for crafting beautiful and functional
          software. From a young age, I've been fascinated by technology and its
          potential to transform our world. This curiosity led me to pursue a
          degree in computer science at CECOS University, where I'm currently
          immersed in learning the intricacies of software development.
          Throughout my academic journey, I've had the privilege of working on
          diverse projects that have honed my skills and broadened my
          understanding of various programming languages and frameworks. My
          passion lies not only in writing efficient code but also in creating
          intuitive user experiences that delight and engage users. I'm excited
